# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
![Conceptual Diagram (Napkin)](assets/AWS-Bootcamp_Banner.jpg)
- In this week, we learnt about a variety of technologies to progress with our containerization knowledge. Some of the things we learnt include: 
    * Exploring the codebases (Frontend and Backend)
    * How to run the frontend and backend locally without using docker
    * How to write a Dockerfile for each app
    * How to build and get the apps running via individual containers
    * how to create a docker-compose file
    * How we can orchestrate multiple containers to run side by side
    * How to mount directories so we can make changes while we code

## Required Homework/Tasks
- To test if we grasped the concepts provided to us through the meeting as well as the provided videos to aid us, we were given homeworks. They are:
    - [X] Research best practices of Dockerfiles and attempt to implement it in your Dockerfile.
    - [X] Use multi-stage building for a Dockerfile build.
    - [X] Running the dockerfile CMD as an external script.
    - [X] Implement a healthcheck in the V3 Docker compose file.
    - [X] Learn how to install Docker on your localmachine and get the same containers running outside of Gitpod / Codespaces.
    - [] Push and tag a image to DockerHub.
    - [] Launch an EC2 instance that has docker installed, and pull a container to demonstrate you can run your own docker processes. 

- I will describe my work and the process I overcame in the order provided above.

### Researching best practices for Dockerfiles
- I researched best practices for dockerfiles from different sites as well as from [Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/) for best practices. I learnt a lot about layering in docker, how caching works as well as how secrets and environment variables are handled. I'll dive deep about what I implemented with this new found knowledge especially in the coming homework sections. Some of the things I've learnt are provided below.
    - **Keeping the image size small** by using multi-stage builds and only including the necessary files and libraries to keep the image size small. This will help with faster deployment and reduce resource usage.
    - **Using official images** from the Docker Hub repository whenever possible, as they are maintained by the Docker community and are regularly updated with security patches.
    - **Creating a .dockerignore file** in the project directory to exclude unnecessary files and directories from the Docker build context. This significantly reduced the build time and image size for me personally.
    - **Using environment variables** instead of hardcoding values in the Dockerfile to make the image more configurable, easier to maintain and more secure.
    - **Using a specific tag for versioning**, such as a commit hash or a version number, to ensure that the same version of the image can be reproduced in the future.
    - **Limiting the number of layers in the Dockerfile**, as each layer adds overhead to the image size and can slow down the build process.
    - **Using a health check** in the Dockerfile to ensure that the container is running correctly and to detect any issues before they cause downtime.
    - **Removing any unnecessary files or dependencies** that were installed during the build process to keep the image size small and reduce potential security risks.
    - **Documenting the Dockerfile** by including clear and concise comments in the Dockerfile to document what the image does, how it should be used, and any configuration options.
    - **Testing the image thoroughly** to ensure that it works as expected and meets the requirements of the application or service it will be used for.
